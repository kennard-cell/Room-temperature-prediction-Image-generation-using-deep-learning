# Room-Temperature-Prediction-Image-Generation-using-Deep-Learning
The first model predicts future room temperature based on environmental sensor data (temperature, humidity, and light intensity) using a neural network regression approach. The second model applies generative modeling to learn visual patterns from image data and generate synthetic images.
